# SingtelQuestion
Mostly i used dependency injection on the questions for maintainablity.
In question A, i created a BirdInterface class. So each of the birds (Chicken, Duck) will implements the interface to performs actions.

In question B, i created a FishInterface class and implements to all fishes. For shark and Clownfish, i use constructor method to specialize their characteristic.

In question D, i created an InsectInterface class and implements to Butterfly and Caterpillar. For Caterpillar metamorphosis to Butterfly, i use inheritance method and override the butterfly fly method.
